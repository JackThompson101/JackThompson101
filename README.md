## Projects

### Set-Top Box Vulnerability Research 
During my time at Caeser Creek Software I:
- Identified and analyzed pre-installed malware and backdoors.
- Exploited a hardware vulnerability through the microSD card port to enable JTAG, reverse shell, and UART access.
- Developed a flexible JTAG replay solution using a Raspberry Pi Pico and custom PCB, achieving persistent reverse shell access across multiple embedded devices.
